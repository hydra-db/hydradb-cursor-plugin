# Conformance

This directory is the plugin's half of the shared anti-drift gate described in
`CONTRACT.md` §4. It proves the plugin's wrapper speaks the canonical HydraDB
vocabulary and does not diverge from the other clients or from the pinned SDK.

## Files

- **`vectors.json`** - the shared, language-neutral fixtures (request shape in →
  expected canonical SDK call out). **Identical across all four client repos;
  maintained centrally.** Do not edit a single repo's copy - a change is one PR
  per repo against the master.
- **`runner.mjs`** - drives every vector through the canonical wrapper
  (`scripts/lib/hydra/`) against the **real vendored SDK** with a capturing
  `fetch`, and asserts the actual wire call each vector expects (method, scope,
  content-type, forbidden/required fields, client-id preservation).
- **`tests.mjs`** - HTTP-level wire tests (the repo's first) and golden `--json`
  shape snapshots:
  - the DX-G-002 guard: knowledge ingest is `multipart/form-data` with a
    top-level `tenant_id` and the source in `app_knowledge` (never
    `application/json`, never `app_sources`), preserving the client-assigned id;
  - delete-by-kind routing and the "deleted nothing" surfacing fix;
  - the recall round-trip (camelCase SDK response → normalized chunks);
  - golden key-shape snapshots of `query`/`doctor`/`last-recall` `--json`, the
    shapes marketplace-shipped skill files parse.
- **`golden/`** - committed key-shape snapshots. Regenerate intentionally with
  `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 npm run check` and review the diff.

## Running

All of it runs as part of CI via:

```bash
npm run check
```

`check.mjs` calls `runConformance()`, `runHttpTests()`, and `runGoldenTests()`.
